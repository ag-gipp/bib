  \section{JabRef workaround}

   Do your change in Jabref

   Make a pull request

   Wait for BibBot to correct the formatting

   Merge the PR

   Option a (squash merge) you will need to do a fresh checkout afterwards

   Option b (rebase merge or merge commit) the history will contain the intermediate chage cause by jabref.
   This will cause problems with git blame, since the lines you change won't be attributed to you.

  This document is supposed to use \verb \nocite{*} \verb to cite all bibtex entries.
  However, currently some bibtex entries simply do not work. Thus only selected bibtex entries are printed.
